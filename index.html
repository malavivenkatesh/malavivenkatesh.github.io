        <h3>Extreme PALS</h3>
        <p>
            Want to enter an official hackathon but feeling daunted by its unfamiliarity?
            Well, Extreme PALS is for you!
            <br>
            This hackathon will run over one whole day for 12 hours with breaks for a workshop and lunch.
            Participants, in small teams of up to 3-4 people,
            can stand a chance to win prizes by creating a game together based on a provided theme and framework.
            <br>Extreme PALS has the support of Volker Seeker, the lecturer for object oriented programming, a
            compulsory course for first year computer science students. By integrating the material with his course
            syllabus, you can level-up your Java skills with some hands-on experience.
            See this as an introduction to your hackathon journey.
